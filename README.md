# ASP.NET Core Security
This repository provides a concise overview of the book "ASP.NET Core Security" by Christian Wenz. It follows the same structure as the book, but with a lighter touch on each topic. While the book offers in-depth explanations, this repository focuses on covering the key points.

If a particular topic requires further exploration, a simple ASP.NET Core application will be created to demonstrate a relevant scenario. This will help solidify your understanding of the concepts.
